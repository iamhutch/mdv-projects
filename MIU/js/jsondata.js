				"lesson": "There are three things a person needs to know in order to become a Christian and then live a fulfilling life in Christ.1) You need to know you are a sinner. 2) You need to know how you can be forgiven for your sins. 3) You need to know how you should respond to God’s forgiveness. Why this is important to know: In order to grow in Christ we need to know how to respond to God’s grace. What Christ has done for us effects how we live. We do good works, not to be saved, but because Christ has saved us (Eph 2:10). We forgive because Christ has forgiven us (Matt 6:12). We bless because Christ has blessed us (Eph 1:3). We served because Christ has served us (Mrk 10:45). We love because Christ has loved us (1 Jhn 4:19)."
