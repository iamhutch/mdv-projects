				<h3>What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?</h3>
				<p>Here are the native features that you can implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS and PhoneGap:  accelerometer, camera, contacts, file, geolocation, media, network, notifications (alert, sound, vibration) and storage.</p>
				
				<h3>For your CRUD app revision and/or Demo App components, which of these do you think you will implement?</h3>
				<p>I am planning on implementing the geolocation, notification, contacts and camera.</p>
				
				<h3>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</h3>
				<p>I have learned that you must do your research first and then the design, followed by the development.  I have worked in projects where they got 
				started but didn’t know about different trends and norms that were needed.  So they had to go back and research that.  Then they got to the design and found out that certain things didn’t work or flow the way they wanted them to.  
				So it was back to researching how they should flow.  Lastly, the development is started when all these areas have been worked out.</p>
				
				<h3>Please describe any design intentions you may have for the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.</h3>
				<p>I plan on changing the app from a bible study tool type app called Pocket Ministry to a disciplee tracker called Go Disciple.  Instead of listing out bible study lessons, it will contain information on a person that a leader or anyone is discipling.  This will allow me to add the geolocation, contact, and notification features.</p>
				
				<h3>If not covered above, please also describe any functionality intentions you may have for both the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.</h3>
				<p>I’m thinking of adding FileUploader to the app in case there are supporting documents that might need to be added for the tracker.</p>

				<h3>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible?</h3>
				<p>I think that I could make sure that I keep as close as possible to the accessibility guidelines like adding the alt value to all images and making sure that my text links have very descriptive wording.</p>
				
				<h3>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</h3>
				<p>What I saw were that many pages were just not tagged correctly nor have they implemented accessibility features at all.  They would get “Click Here” but have no idea what they were clicking.  I would fix as much as I could so that they could also experience the internet just a little bit more.</p>
				
				<h3>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h3>
				<p><strong>Alternative keyboards</strong> - these feature larger than standard keys, have alternative key configurations or they’re able to be used with just one hand.</p>
                <p><strong>Electronic pointing devices</strong> - they are used to control the cursor on the screen without using their hands.  They include infrared beams, eye movements, ultrasound, nerve signals, or brain waves.</p>

				<h3>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h3>
				<p><strong>soundAmp (iOS)</strong> - Takes the sounds picked up by the device microphone and amplifies it to your ear buds, making it into a hearing aid.</p>
                <p><strong>iBlink Radio (iOS)</strong> - App with podcasts, reading service, and music stations of interest to the blind.</p>
