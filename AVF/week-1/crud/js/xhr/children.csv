For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him." (Jhn 3:16-17)By Grace, Through Faith|Bible Study Planet|contact@biblestudyplanet.com|2/18/12|Family|Old Testament|Exodus|Children|90|"It is by grace you have been saved, through faith and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God not by works, so that no one can boast." Ephesians 2:8-9 God is gracious Because God is gracious, sinful people are forgiven, converted, purified, and saved. It's not because of anything in them, or anything that ever can be in them, that they are saved; it's because of the boundless love, goodness, pity, compassion, mercy, and grace of God. It's because 'his love endures forever' (1 Chronicles 16:41) that we are not destroyed. It's because 'his compassions never fail (Lamentations 3:22) that sinners are brought to Him and forgiven. Remember these things or you may fall into error by focusing so much on your faith that you forget that grace is the source of faith itself.Honoring Your Parents Part 4; Let The Healing Begin|Pastor Terry Gurno|contact@biblestudyplanet.com|2/1/12|Family|Old Testament|Exodus|Children|90|"Family is so precious. It's absolutely priceless. God knows that, and that's why he places such high value on the family. Relationship with God, then relationship with family. That's not by accident, that's by design. For those of you we prayed for (In the Introduction), I pray God has been able to speak to you. Really what I am praying for is this would be a freeing message. God is not asking you to live in denial. He is not asking you to deny your feelings. He is asking you to be honest with them, and face them, so that you are not holding on to bitterness or unforgiveness and just passing them on. Then you can be the training center within your homes that God intended you to be. I want to challenge you, if you struggle with this, find one thing to honor your parents for.
