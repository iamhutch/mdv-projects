(Exodus 20:12) I know that when I read this commandment there are some people, and I am one of them, who have struggled to work through this commandment in our life. Some of you right now didn't even like the way that verse read or sounded because honestly you don't know why or how or what would be the reason to literally honor your mother and father."Honoring Your Parents Part 2 - Five Things Family Teaches Us,Pastor Terry Gurno|contact@biblestudyplanet.com|2/14/12|Family|Old Testament|Exodus|Youth|90|"This commandment is so important because it lists the value of your family. The family is the birthplace of a lot of things, and we are going to talk about five of those things in this study. 1) FAMILY IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF YOUR VALUES 2) FAMILY IS A RELATIONSHIP TRAINING CENTER 3) FAMILY IS WHERE WE LEARN ABOUT AUTHORITY 4) FAMILY IS WHERE WE LEARN OUR VALUE AS A HUMAN 5) FAMILY IS WHERE WE LEARN ABOUT FAITH"Honoring Our Parents Part 3 - How We Honor Our Parents|Pastor Terry Gurno|contact@biblestudyplanet.com|2/13/12|Family|Old Testament|Exodus|Youth|90|"Why Should We Obey Our Parents? Because God promises you a long life. Notice at the end of this Commandment it says, "Honor your father and mother so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you." (Exodus 20:12). So not only live long, but notice it says, 'In the land your God is giving you.' He is not talking about individuals, He is talking about society and when the family unit breaks down, the society breaks down. Nobody knows that better than the United States of America because it is the greatest battle, and it is the greatest challenge that we face. The preservation of the family unit is the preservation of generations to follow. The family is the backbone of society. 'That you may live long in the land as a society, as a unit,' that's what God is really talking about."Honoring Your Parents Part 4 - Let The Healing Begin|Pastor Terry Gurno|contact@biblestudyplanet.com|2/19/12|Family|Old Testament|Exodus|Youth|90|"Family is so precious. It's absolutely priceless. God knows that, and that's why he places such high value on the family. Relationship with God, then relationship with family. That's not by accident, that's by design. For those of you we prayed for (In the Introduction), I pray God has been able to speak to you. Really what I am praying for is this would be a freeing message. God is not asking you to live in denial. He is not asking you to deny your feelings. He is asking you to be honest with them, and face them, so that you are not holding on to bitterness or unforgiveness and just passing them on. Then you can be the training center within your homes that God intended you to be. I want to challenge you, if you struggle with this, find one thing to honor your parents for.""By Grace Through Faith"|Bible Study Planet|contact@biblestudyplanet.com|2/29/12|Family|Old Testament|Exodus|Youth|90|"It is by grace you have been saved, through faith and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God not by works, so that no one can boast."" Ephesians 2:8-9 God is gracious, Because God is gracious, sinful people are forgiven, converted, purified, and saved. It's not because of anything in them, or anything that ever can be in them, that they are saved; it's because of the boundless love, goodness, pity, compassion, mercy, and grace of God. It's because 'his love endures forever' (1 Chronicles 16:41) that we are not destroyed. It's because 'his compassions never fail' (Lamentations 3:22) that sinners are brought to Him and forgiven. Remember these things or you may fall into error by focusing so much on your faith that you forget that grace is the source of faith itself."7 Commands for Christian Living|Bible Study Planet|contact@biblestudyplanet.com|2/11/12|Christian Life|New Testament|1 Thessalonians|Youth|90|"Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.
